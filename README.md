# Scholar Stream

## Purpose

ScholarStream is a full-stack MERN-based web application designed to connect students with scholarship opportunities through a centralized platform. It simplifies the process of discovering, applying for, and managing scholarships by allowing students to browse and apply for scholarships online, moderators to review applications and update their status, and administrators to manage users, scholarships, and analytics. The system reduces complexity, improves transparency, and streamlines scholarship management for both applicants and institutions.
